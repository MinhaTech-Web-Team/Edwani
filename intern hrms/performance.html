                    <p>When it comes to attendance, I have ensured punctuality and regularity, understanding the
                        importance of being present and dependable. I would like to sincerely thank Sir Wasiq for his
                        ongoing support, guidance, and encouragement, which play a major role in keeping me motivated
                        and focused. I am grateful for the opportunity to work under his leadership and look forward to
